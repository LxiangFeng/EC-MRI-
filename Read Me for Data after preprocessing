The data after preprocessing.
This study utilizes two datasets, 1A and 1B, which consist of both raw data and detection prediction datasets generated using the YOLO model for cropping. 
The raw data from 1A and 1B are primarily employed for model training and validation, while the YOLO-cropped datasets deliver more precise object detection outcomes, 
thereby improving the model's performance and accuracy. Through a thorough analysis of these datasets, this work lays a solid foundation for future research and practical applications.
Due to file upload restrictions, we will upload the dataset in batches.
